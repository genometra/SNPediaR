Description: SNPediaR provides some tools for downloading and parsing
        data from the SNPedia web site <http://www.snpedia.com>. The
        implemented functions allow users to import the wiki text
        available in SNPedia pages and to extract the most relevant
        information out of them. If some information in the downloaded
        pages is not automatically processed by the library functions,
        users can easily implement their own parsers to access it in an
        efficient way.
